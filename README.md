# Grocery App

I builded a simple shopping list application using Django and React. The app allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on groceries items.


## Technologies

- `Django:` Python-based web framework for building the backend API.
- `Django Rest Framework (DRF):` Toolkit for building Web APIs using Django.
- `React:` JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- `Axios:` Promise-based HTTP client for making requests from the frontend to the backend API.
